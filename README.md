# BallJumper
BallJumper is a 2D-Platformer game. There is two levels, the first one is easier than the second one. In the game, player tries to complete the level as fast as he can and collect the coins as much as possible. The player have movement mechanics and jump mechanics.
I made all of in this project, but not graphics and gameobjects because I used ready-made assets in this project.
